# 7days-to-die-mods
A collection of various 7 Days to Die Mods I have created.


## Modlets Included

* [**Better Paper Crafting**](/BetterPaperCrafting/README.md) - Adds the ability to craft paper from wood, clay and plant fibers using the chemistry station. It allows you to keep up with paper demands once you have reached end game and are using it for shotgun shells and paper is hard to come by in bulk.
