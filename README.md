# 7 Days to Die Mods
A collection of various 7 Days to Die Mods I have created.


## Modlets Included

* [**Better Paper Crafting**](/BetterPaperCrafting/README.md) - Adds the ability to craft paper from wood, clay and plant fibers using the chemistry station. It allows you to keep up with paper demands once you have reached end game and are using it for shotgun shells and paper is hard to come by in bulk.

* [**Craftable Water Filter**](/CraftableWaterFilter/README.md) - This mod allows you to craft the water filter item at a workbench rather than having to buy it from the trader.

* [**Better Storage Options**](/BetterStorageOptions/README.md) - This mod provides you with more storage options such as crafting hardened crates, ammunition boxes, military boxes that act like normal storage boxes. **Note:** This mod is currently a work in progress.
